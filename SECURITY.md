# RealEngine Security Policy

This Security Policy outlines the guidelines for ensuring the safety and integrity of the RealEngine project, community members, and code contributions. We encourage a proactive approach to security, and any identified vulnerabilities or concerns should be reported and addressed swiftly.

## 1. Secure Coding Practices
All contributors to the RealEngine repository must adhere to secure coding practices, including:
- **Input validation:** Ensure all inputs from users and external systems are validated.
- **Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all code and components. Only expose the necessary parts of the system.
- **Cryptographic Practices:** Use industry-standard cryptography to protect sensitive data.

## 2. Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability in RealEngine or related systems, please follow the steps below:
1. **Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities** until they are resolved.
2. Report the vulnerability by opening a **private issue** on GitHub or via email to **[dylewskianthony@gmail.com]**.
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including:
   - Reproduction steps
   - Affected components
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

## 3. Code Review Process
Security must be a priority during code reviews. All pull requests will be subject to security checks, and contributors are encouraged to:
- Review code for any security flaws or vulnerabilities.
- Use automated tools to scan for common vulnerabilities.
- Ensure all security patches are tested before merging.

## 4. Dependency Management
RealEngine uses third-party dependencies to reduce development time. All dependencies must:
- Be regularly checked for security updates and patches.
- Be reviewed for security risks before integration.
- Be up-to-date with the latest stable and secure versions.

## 5. Access Control
All contributors should follow the principle of **least privilege** with respect to repository access and permissions. Maintain access only to necessary areas and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable.

## 6. Data Protection
Ensure that any personal or sensitive data, whether from users or developers, is handled securely:
- Sensitive data must be encrypted during storage and transmission.
- Personal data must be anonymized wherever possible.

## 7. Regular Security Audits
Regular audits should be conducted on the repository to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security gaps. Security audits should include:
- Codebase vulnerability scanning.
- Dependency audits.
- System architecture reviews.

## 8. Community Engagement
We encourage everyone in the RealEngine community to:
- Stay informed about the latest security developments in the field of game engines.
- Participate in discussions around improving the security of RealEngine.
- Be mindful of social engineering tactics and phishing attempts, and report any suspicious activity.

By following these practices, we can ensure RealEngine remains secure and trusted by the community.
